            In 5th grade, I overslept the morning of math triathlon auditions, and I didn't make the team.
            It
            was a real blow to my elementary ego, and so I regrettably joined the chess club instead. I had
            a
            pretty good season, and I think I only lost two matches. If it wasn’t cemented by then, it was
            clear
            to me now that I was a nerd; a badge I wear proudly still <span id="dots">...</span>
          </p>
          <span id="more">
            <p>
              In middle school, I started playing percussion, and for the first time started to take music
              seriously. I took private lessons, and then after eighth grade my parents bought me my first
              drum
              set. I don’t know how they functioned in that house, because drums are so loud, and I don’t
              remember
              ever playing soft; I was really into punk rock and started my first band my sophomore year,
              while
              still being very active in marching band at school.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drums, and music to an extent, are very logical; there are time signatures, keys, tempos,
              and
              patterns. Lyrics and rhyme schemes are patterns, repetitions of sounds and syllables focused
              on
              some
              theme. I started writing lyrics in high school, and I’m so thankful no one can read them;
              I’m
              sure
              they were terrible, but they were a start.
            </p>
            <p>
              In college, I majored in Sound Recording Technology, a degree program in the school of music
              that
              focused evenly on physics, music theory, and performance. The further I advanced into music
              theory,
              learning about chords and progressions, the more patterns I was exposed to. I created a band
              called
              Zlam Dunk with some friends, and we played a lot of shows, first starting in apartments that
              would
              be shut down by noise complaints, and eventually we were playing around Austin at clubs I
              would
              see
              my favorite bands in. We made an EP, and two full length records, recording in studios
              around
              Austin. I even engineered and produced our last record, which was an amazing learning
              experiment. We
              went on three East Coast tours, playing multiple shows in New York City, Boston,
              Philadelphia,
              and
              more. Touring in a van is simultaneously amazing and horrible, and figuring out where to
              sleep
              or
              eat can be a nightmare, but you also meet the nicest people and make wonderful memories.
            </p>
            <p>
              After college, I continued to play music with bands, but quickly realized the life of a
              musician
              wasn’t going to allow me time to have a life outside of clubs and recording studios, and I
              pivoted
              towards education. I had flirted with the idea in college, and while working as temp in HR
              at
              Austin
              ISD, the opportunity to earn an alternative certification presented itself, and in 2013 I
              started
              teaching high school math at the Alternative Learning Center, which is a discipline
              alternative
              education program. A true baptism by fire, reaching young adults who had been removed from
              their
              home schools due to drugs or gang behavior was a challenge, but I truly I thrived there. My
              students
              were punishing and challenging, but they were also sweet and kind and hoping to be heard; if
              you
              treated them with respect and tried to understand where they were coming from, they were the
              same as
              any student at any other school. They taught me a lot, and I miss working with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you can imagine, working four years at an alternative school started to burn me out, and
              eventually moved to McCallum High school, the fine arts magnet school for Austin. They asked
              if
              I
              could teach AP Computer Science, and I knew I could learn. I got certified all while
              finishing
              Graduate School at the University of Texas. The next three years were my happiest in
              education;
              the
              students at McCallum are quirky, creative, and hilarious. I taught some amazing students,
              some
              of
              which were exceptionally intelligent, and pushed me to be a better teacher, to understand
              concepts
              deeper. My final year, I taught PreAP PreCalculus, PreAP Algebra 1, AP Computer Science, and
              an
              OnRamps Computer Science course. It was stressful, but immensely rewarding. After seven
              years of
              teaching, I have a new respect for thinking deeply on a subject. To teach anything you have
              to
              analyze a concept from several angles and really understand how it functions; I think the
              ability to
              do that will serve me well in my next career.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through it all I have continued to make music, forming a couple of bands to handle different
              genres
              and aspects of my personality. In 2020 I put out an EP I’d been working on for four years on
              some of
              my most personal music, and another single for another band that probably took six years to
              make. I
              find the pursuit of writing and recording music to be the main driving force; I don’t think
              I’ll
              ever produce a track as good as the ones my idols have, but it’s something I can keep trying
              to
              do.
